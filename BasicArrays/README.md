To IMPORT this project into your eclipse workspace, follow the steps below.
Also, if you have any questions email Tyler @ sylsr9@gmail.com

	1. Open eclipse
	2. In eclipse file -> import
	3. Expand General -> existing projects into workspace
	4. Click the browse button next to "select root directory
	5. Navigate to where ever you downloaded the BullbotsLearning folder.
	6. Select {Download Spot}/BullbotsTraining/BasicArrays as the base folder
	7. Make sure that in the projects window "BasicArrays" is selected

	8. Click finish - hope that everything worked out. You should see the project in the left side projects panel. It will be named “BasicArrays”.

If you need any additional help see this website: https://www.360logica.com/blog/how-to-import-a-java-project-into-eclipse-ide/


From here you should expand BasicArrays → src → (default package).
You can right click on Tester.java → click “Run As” → and then click “Java Application”.

This will run merge sort and then run crappy sort (the thing you need to finish!). You will most likely want to change the size of the array you are sorting. You can find this on line 29 of Tester.java. 

NOTE: crappy sort isn’t finished and has a bug in it. I fixed my bug with 3 additional lines of code (just to give you an idea of how far off it is from working). But it is also would be a good idea if you just want to delete everything in that method and try to figure out how to sort an array by yourself!
